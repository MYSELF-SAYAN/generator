# <a name="introduction"> SQL & HTML code Generator with a Color Code Genrator </a>

🚀 Excited to share my latest project on hashtag#React! 🎨 I've created an app integrating Gemini AI, featuring two awesome functionalities:

1️⃣ SQL & HTML Code Generator with prompt history for efficient coding workflows.

2️⃣ Color Code Generator: Upload a picture, and voila! It generates a list of all color codes present in the image, ready to be copied to clipboard.

🎯 My main goal with this project was to dive into SQL for the first time while leveraging Gemini AI's capabilities. It's been an incredible learning journey! For the frontend, I utilized Tailwind CSS, and for state management I used Redux.js.
